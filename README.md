# Matrix Robot
Robot scene animated purely by matrix calculations.  
All limbs of the robot are made with scaling matrices and are placed in the scene with translation matrices.
We then animate the robot using rotation and translation matrices.
The robot has a walk animation, can move each limb indepently and can look around.  
The [three.js](https://threejs.org/) library is used for the rendering of the scene.  
This project was made with [Martin Medina](https://github.com/medinammartin3) for the IFT3355 UdeM course.
